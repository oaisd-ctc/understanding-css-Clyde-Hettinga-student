        <p>Here, have some shower thoughts and maybe an existensial crisis</p>

        <ul>
            <li>What if we're all in a cosmic video game and refrigerators are the save points?</li>
            <li>Maybe mythical creatures used to exist, but interbred with all the non-magic organisms</li>
            <li>If the world is a story, how would anyone know who's the main character and who's an NPC?</li>
        </ul>
